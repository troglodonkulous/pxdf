/**
 * PR 2's gate, on the wire, with the real app running.
 *
 * `engine.test.ts` grades the player's decisions and `sidecar.test.ts` grades
 * the supervisor, but neither of them starts Electron, starts Python, decodes a
 * video or puts a byte on a socket. PR 1's whole failure was a green test suite
 * over a half of the PR that had never been executed — so this script executes
 * it: it launches the built app, drives the real UI over the DevTools protocol,
 * and reads UDP off `127.0.0.1:60001` while it does.
 *
 * It is deliberately not a `vitest` test. It costs Electron, Python and ffmpeg,
 * it takes about half a minute, and a unit-test runner that sometimes needs
 * those is a unit-test runner people stop trusting. Run it by hand:
 *
 *     node test/e2e/wire.mjs
 *
 * ## What it can and cannot see
 *
 * It can see black. An all-zero framebuffer has exactly one wire encoding, so
 * "BLACKOUT is black", "idle is black" and "quitting leaves black behind" are
 * exact assertions here rather than inferences.
 *
 * It cannot see gaplessness, and does not claim to. `Sidecar` re-sends its last
 * frame forever when the renderer stalls, so a frozen cue change and a perfect
 * one are the same bytes. What this script asserts across a change is strictly
 * one-sided: **no black frame appears**. That catches a gap; it cannot prove the
 * absence of a stall, and `engine.test.ts` is what grades that.
 *
 * The clips are solid colours precisely so the one-sided check is sharp: every
 * packet of a non-black frame is then non-zero, and a single all-zero packet
 * body means a black frame rather than a dark corner of a real one.
 *
 * It can also see that the page threw, which it could not until 2026-08-12 and
 * which cost a session. Every check here reads a *wire* symptom, and a renderer
 * that raises the same exception every frame produces wire symptoms that look
 * like six unrelated failures. The last check is the only one that names a
 * cause; see `open` for why `Log.entryAdded` alone was not enough.
 *
 * ## Why the two clips are red and white rather than red and blue
 *
 * The cue-change check has to prove the change *happened* before "no black
 * appeared during it" means anything at all — otherwise a second cue that never
 * decodes leaves the first one on the wire for the whole window and the check
 * passes green having measured nothing. That was this file's first draft, and
 * it is the same laundering `CLAUDE.md` opens with.
 *
 * Telling the two apart has to survive the packet framing. A packet body is 507
 * or 453 bytes — neither divisible by 3 — so a body is not RGB-aligned and
 * per-channel sums are phase-shifted by the packet's offset into the
 * framebuffer. Red versus blue is therefore not decidable from one packet. Red
 * versus white is: a red framebuffer is `(255, 0, 0)` repeating, so about a
 * third of its bytes are non-zero, and a white one is all 255s. That ratio does
 * not care about phase.
